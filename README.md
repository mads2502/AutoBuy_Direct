##Deep Learning based model for Auto segmentation of Car images from Natural Background enabling succesful resale


This project uses UNET segmentation model for implementing a segmentation tool that can extract car images from natural backgrounds and apply Image Processing techniques for enabling effective resale of the car.

The UNET model was implemented using the VGG-16 architechture and a custom built dataset was used to train the model and obtained results of a car from various angles being converted into a 360 degree view of the vehicle.
